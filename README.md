# DataAddons
<h2>This library is an open-source component of TabLight project's "Base-API"</h2>

DataAddons is a library (or framework?) created for Minecraft providing comfortable abstractions making additions over already existing data, generally, **it is anti-pattern** ans **YOU SHOULDN'T USE IT** in normal programms. \
So why is it needed? It is needed for registering and managing *custom* types and composing them out of different "sources" of data. \
